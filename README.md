# Rush-HD-Pictures
This contains all the HD Card pictures for Rush Duels on edopro

#### How to install ? 

- Download the configs file by [clicking here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/c3angk41lc70amr/user_configs.json/file)
- Go into your Project Ignis folder (If you did not change any setting when installing Edopro, it should be in your C:/ directory)
- Drag and drop the downloaded file into the "configs" folder
- Restart edopro. 

Do note that on first installation, images can take a while to download, so you won't see them immediately.
After that though, the game will auto-update with new cards so you do not need to download anymore.
