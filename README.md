#### Install Links

- [Base Pack](https://www.mediafire.com/file/c3angk41lc70amr/user_configs.json/file)
- [Base Pack + ORR Extension](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ebzmqkv3vs9pc0y/user_configs.json/file)

For more information on the "ORR Extension", check out [the ORR Extension repository](https://github.com/Yoshi80/Rush-HD-ORR-Extension).

#### How to install ? 

- Download any configs file you want by clicking on of the links in the **Install Links** section. (There is no need to download both)
- Go into your Project Ignis folder (If you did not change any setting when installing Edopro, it should be in your C:/ directory)
- Drag and drop the downloaded file into the "configs" folder
- Restart edopro. 

Do note that on first installation, images can take a while to download, so you won't see them immediately. The game won't be usable during the duration of the installation.
SSL Timeout errors are expected due to the high number of pictures to download. Simply restart your game until the errors stop showing up.
After that though, the game will auto-update with new cards so you do not need to download anymore.
